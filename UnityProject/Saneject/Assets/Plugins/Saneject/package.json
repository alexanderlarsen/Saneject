Bind and resolve your dependencies entirely in the Editor with an inspector-first workflow, including full support for serialized interfaces. No runtime container, no extra lifecycles. Just fast, deterministic DI that feels native to Unity.",

      "description": "A minimal set of example extension methods built on top of Saneject’s component filter API. Shows how you can add your own sugar methods (e.g. filter by parent name, child name, ancestor tag, sibling layer) by composing the core `Where`, `WhereTransform`, and `WhereGameObject` predicates. These examples are intentionally small and non-exhaustive. They’re meant as a starting point for writing your own project-specific filters. The same extension pattern also applies to the asset filter API.",
